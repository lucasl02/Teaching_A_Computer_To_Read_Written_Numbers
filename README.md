# Teaching_A_Computer_To_Read_Written_Numbers
In this project, image classification was conducted and evaluated
in MATLAB. The procedure to achieve this involved several compu-
tational methods including the Wavelet Transform, Principal Compo-
nent Analysis, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. The Wavelet Trans-
form was used to detect crucial features of each image, Principal Com-
ponent Analysis of the Wavelet Transform was done to find a basis to
separate the distinct features, and Linear Discriminant Analysis was
used to determine the threshold that separates the distinct classes.
